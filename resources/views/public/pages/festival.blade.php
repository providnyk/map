                    Through its annual festival and close cooperation with its partners, CULTURESCAPES'
                    goal is to allow audiences to gain a deeper insight into the current cultural and
                    creative activities of a country (region, landscape).

                <p>CULTURESCAPES sees culture as a dynamic and versatile process that combines both the
                    joy of artistic expression and the exploration of contrasts and contradictions. </p>
                <p>CULTURESCAPES wishes to make these ideas informative and appealing to an enthusiastic
                    and receptive audience through the organisation of the programme and the choice or
                    artists. Cooperation with artists is characterised by a friendly and respectful
                    attitude with the common goal of presenting a high-quality and attractive festival
                    for all those who come to see it. We believe artistic independence is the key
                    ingredient and view it as a valuable aspect of dialogue and mutual trust.
                    CULTURESCAPES uses co-productions, commissioned works and competitions to promote
                    young artists.</p>
