## About Providnyk

PROVODNYK addresses the problem of the quality of life of Ukrainians with limited mobility by allowing its users add and evaluate the accessibility of infrastructure objects already in 5 cities. It also helps consolidate the efforts of the civil society, state, business and public in building an inclusive society in Ukraine.

Users can plan the accessible route and create point-to-point directions, add objects (locations) with and without inclusive infrastructure on the city maps, and review the objects, adding photos and texts. When an object gets certain number of negative reviews, the system automatically sends a request (complaint) to the relevant authorities.

The main users of the application are people with special needs in commuting, like people with disabilities or temporary mobility limitations, parents with strollers and elderly people, and activists working on the rights of people with disabilities, urban development, etc. PROVODNYK also engages socially responsible businesses, government agencies, CSOs working on e-Democracy and public administration reform, and other civic tech initiatives.
